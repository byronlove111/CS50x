## :label: **About CS50**

**[CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)** is Harvard University's premier introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. The course rigorously explores languages such as C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS & JavaScript, as well as foundational computer science concepts including algorithms & data structures, abstraction, encapsulation, resource management, security, and the sophisticated Flask web framework.

## :computer: **About the Repository**

A cornerstone of the CS50 experience is the submission of labs, problem sets, and a final project for critical feedback and assessment. This repository houses my comprehensive solutions for these academically challenging tasks. The final project, a capstone of my learning journey, is meticulously detailed in a separate repository linked below.

Additionally, you will find links and succinct descriptions of each project's requirements and my implementation thereof. These artifacts reflect the depth and breadth of knowledge acquired over the course.

## :closed_book: **Academic Integrity**

Upholding the course's [academic integrity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/) standards is paramount. You are encouraged to intellectually wrestle with problems yourself before consulting external solutions. Bear in mind, I am also traversing the learning curve of this discipline; my implementations may reflect novice approaches aiming for educational growth rather than optimality.
